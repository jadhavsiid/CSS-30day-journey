# Typography in CSS

- Typography is the soul of UI/UX design!
It's not just about choosing fonts — it's about how text reads, flows, and feels.

**Key Concepts**

| `font-family` | Choose a typeface — use fallbacks! e.g. 'Inter', sans-serif |
| `font-size` | Use relative units like rem or % for responsive design |
| `font-weight` | Ranges from 100–900, or bold, normal, etc. |

| `word-spacing` | Adjust space between words |
| `text-align` | 	left, right, center, justify |
